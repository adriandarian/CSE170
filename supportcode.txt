VISUAL STUDIO

The support code provides project files for Visual Studio. We use the Visual Studio Community version, which is a free version and it works great.

If you install Visual Studio, you just need to install the "Desktop Development with C++" option. Both versions 2017 and 2019 can be used.

SUPPORT CODE

Our support code SIG is available at:
https://bitbucket.org/mkallmann/sig/

A pre-compiled version will be also posted in CatCourses.

RUNNING THE SIG EXAMPLES

- Un7zip the SIG support code in your work directory.
- In the file manager go inside the vs2017 folder.
- Double click sigfull.sln from inside the vs2017 folder to launch VS.
- Right-Click on an example project to select it.
- You can run it with Ctrl+F5 (or from one of the menu commands)
- The 7zip will have pre-compiled libraries, to re-compile you need to re-build the solution
- Executables and libraries are smaller if you select "Release" mode in the toolbar.
- Recall that when you work in a lab computer your desktop files are erased, so be sure to save your work in a safe place.

SIG FORUM

Of course, come to the labs to ask for help and exchange ideas. In addition, this year we will be using a forum to help answer questions:

WORKING ON PAs and PROJECTs

- You will typically work with 2 Visual Studio instances: one with SIG so that you can read header files and check how the examples are implemented, and another with your project/PA in development.
- Both projects have to be on the same folder.
